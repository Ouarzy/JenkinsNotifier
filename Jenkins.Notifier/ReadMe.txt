How to run Jenkins Notifier?

- Run the application
- Enter your Jenkins ID
- Enter your Jenkins API Token (In Jenkins go to the person's config page (/user/<username>/configure) and click on the Show API Token button.)
- Enter the refresh timer (in seconds)
- Enter nothing more if you want to display all the views of your server
OR
- Enter one or more valid view name with their valid Jobs Name

It will display one tab by jobs, notify you one per job failed, and one when the job back to normal.
